This is an introductory tutorial on writing an expert for MT5. The expert uses a simple moving average cross as a template example.

This video is for 2 reasons. First it is as I said an introductory video for those just starting out to program for MT5.
Secondly, I plan to use this as a template for future expert videos. That will allow me to keep the future videos shorter by not including basic information each time.
There can be many variations to experts and I will release further introductory expert videos in the future.

The moving average cross used here as an example simply buys each time a fast MA crosses above the slow MA and sells each time the fast MA crosses below the slow MA.
Take profit and stop loss are at a fixed size.

This video is for MT5. I am keeping the MT4 and MT5 versions separated to avoid confusion in the video.
There is a separate video for MT4 with a link below.

MT4 Version: Coming soon
